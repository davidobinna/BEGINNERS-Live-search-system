#Making a Live-Search Prediction form
 This project uses Bootstrap 4, PHP, PDO - MySQL and Ajax. I'm using Bootstrap 4 to design the form, using jQuery - Ajax to send the HTTP request to the server and using PHP as the server-side language with MySQL database. In this project, I'll not only show you how to make Live search Prediction form but also when we click on the searched result then first We'll set the searched result in the search input field and when We'll click on the search button then We'll redirect to other page containing some information about the searched term.

Here I've taken an example of country name search, so when I enter any country name in the search field then according to the entered characters, the list of matching countries will be displayed in the dropdown. And when I click on any country name then it sets in the input field and after when I click on the search button then it goes to another page containing some information about the country, the sql file is avilable to.
